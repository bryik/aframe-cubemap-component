### 4.0.0 (Sep, 6, 2024)

It has been two years since the last publish and updates were needed to make this component work with A-Frame v1.6.0. These updates should be backwards compatible with A-Frame v.1.3.0, but I decided to do a major version increment since it's been so long and I have not kept a close eye on Three.js' breaking changes.
